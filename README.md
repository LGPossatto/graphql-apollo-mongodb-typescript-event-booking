# About

This project is part of this course: [Build a Project with GraphQL, Node, MongoDB, and React.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51rG1x02Yyj93iypUuHYXcB_), 
and is the backend part of the course. It is a GraphQL API where you can create and login with an account, 
create and request events, or book an event.  

I've modified some parts of the project and added new technologies, for example, typescript and apollo server.

Access the playground here: https://type-graphql-api.herokuapp.com/graphql.
